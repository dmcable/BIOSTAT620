## General Information

- BIOSTAT 620 Introduction to Health Data Science
- SPH I 1655
- Tue & Thu 8:30 - 10:00am
- Lecture notes: [https://dmcable.github.io/BIOSTAT620/](https://dmcable.github.io/BIOSTAT620/)
- Canvas: <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/727331>

## Prerequisites

We assume students have taken or are taking a probability and statistics course and have basic programming skills. 

## Textbooks

- [Introduction to Data Science: Data Wrangling and Visualization with R](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/)
- [Introduction to Data Science: Statistics and Prediction Algorithms Through Case Studies](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-2/)

## Course Description

This course introduces the following:

* UNIX/Linux shell
* Reproducible document preparation with RStudio, knitr, and markdown
* Version control with git and GitHub
* R programming
* Data wrangling with dplyr and data.table
* Data visualization with ggplot2

We also demonstrate how the following concepts are applied in data analysis:

* Probability theory
* Statistical inference and modeling
* High-dimensional data techniques
* Machine learning

We do not cover the theory and details of these methods as they are covered in other courses. As an applied course, the goal is to learn the art and science of applying these methods in practice.

Throughout the course, **we use motivating case studies and data analysis problem sets based on challenges similar to those you encounter in scientific research**. 


## Course Structure

For each (approximately weekly) module, we will first teach in lecture the concepts, methods, and skills needed for problem sets. Then, we will start working together on problem sets in in-class labs. It is very important to attend class for this learning experience. On Saturdays, the problem sets will be due (see Key Dates and Problem Sets).

**Please ensure that you read the chapters listed in the syllabus before each lecture.** The lectures are designed with the assumption that you have completed the readings, enabling us to dive deeper into the nuances of data analysis and coding.

**Lectures will not be recorded.**

## Grade Distribution

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| 10 problem sets | 50% |
| Midterm 1 | 10% |
| Midterm 2 | 20% |
| Final project | 20% |

## Problem Sets 

Problem sets will be due every week or every other week, depending on difficulty. They will be due at 11:59 PM on the day denoted on the Problem Sets page.

Some problem sets include open ended questions that will be difficult to answer on your own. **We will be working on these together during labs**. We also offer office hours where you can get help with unanswered questions. Students are encouraged to discuss problem sets and ideas with each other, but the final submission should be your own work.

Problem sets must be submitted via GitHub. **Students are required to have a GitHub account and create a repository for the course.**  We will be providing further instructions during the first lab.

10% of the total points for the problem sets will be deducted for every late day. **Students can have a total of 4 late days without penalty during the entire semester.** No need to provide a written excuse. **Providing an excuse does not give you more days** unless an accommodation is requested and approved by the Office of Student Affairs.

Problem set submissions need to be completely reproducible Quarto documents. **If your Quarto file does not compile** it will be considered a late day, and you will be notified and will need to resubmit a Quarto file that does compile. You will be deducted further late days for every day it takes for you to turn in a Quarto file that does knit. **You are required to check emails that come through the Canvas system**, as this the only way we will communicate problems with your problem sets.


## Midterm Policy

**Both midterms are closed book, no internet, and in-class**. 
You are expected to complete them in 1 hour. 

Questions will be drawn mostly or entirely from the problem sets.

Please make sure you can come to class on the midterm dates provided in the **Key Dates** table below. If you miss the exam, you will need approval from the Office of Student Affairs to receive a makeup. All make-up exams will be completely different from the in-class ones.

## Final Project

For your final project we ask that you turn in a 4-6 page report using data to answer a public health related question. You can chose from one of the following:

* Based on state-level data, how effective where vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 reported cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, and vaccination rates.
* What was the excess mortality after Hurricane Mar√≠a in Puerto Rico? Where different age groups affected differently?
 
Optionally, you can select a question that align with your ongoing research. This way, it can be directly beneficial to your work. This will require prior approval from the instructor by February 27th.

**Note: You should start working on your project after the first midterm. Do not wait until the last week**. Teaching staff will be available during office hours.

## AI tools policy

You can use ChatGPT and other AI tools to assist with questions you may have about code etc. Ultimately, any answers and code that you submit on assignments must be prepared organically by you. Do remember **you won't be able to use these tools during the midterms.**
